Long ago, there was a big cat in the house. He caught many mice while they were stealing food.
从前，一所房子里面有一只大猫，他抓住了很多偷东西的老鼠。
One day the mice had a meeting to talk about the way to deal with their common enemy. Some said this, and some said that.
一天，老鼠在一起开会商量如何对付他们共同的敌人。会上大家各有各的主张，最后，一只小老鼠站出来说他有一个好主意。
At last a young mouse got up, and said that he had a good idea.
最后，一只小老鼠站出来说他有一个好主意。
"We could tie a bell around the neck of the cat. Then when he comes near, we can hear the sound of the bell, and run away."
“我们可以在猫的脖子上绑一个铃铛，那么如果他来到附近，我们听到铃声就可以马上逃跑。”
Everyone approved of this proposal, but an old wise mouse got up and said, "That is all very well, but who will tie the bell to the cat?" The mice looked at each other, but nobody spoke.
大家都赞同这个建议，这时一只聪明的老耗子站出来说：“这的确是个绝妙的主意，但是谁来给猫的脖子上绑铃铛呢?”老鼠们面面相觑，谁也没有说话。
